# Unclic Mobile Apps

This folder contains a minimal React Native setup for the client and professional applications.
It uses [Expo](https://expo.dev/) so the same codebase can run on iOS and Android.

## Getting Started

1. Install `expo-cli` globally:
   ```sh
   npm install -g expo-cli
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   cd mobile && npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```sh
   npx expo start
   ```

This is only a skeleton app with a basic navigation stack. Features from the web
version can be progressively migrated here.
